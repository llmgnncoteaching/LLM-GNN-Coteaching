This repository contains the code of the paper ["Leveraging Large Language Models for Effective Label-free Node
Classification in Text-Attributed Graphs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11983) accepted to SIGIR 2025 Full Paper. To reproduce the results in the paper, please follow the steps:

1. Prepare the environment with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. The above environment may contain some unrelated packages. You can also just install it yourself with some key requirements:

```
python==3.10.0
torch==2.3.0
torch_cluster==1.6.3
torch_geometric==2.5.3
torch_scatter==2.1.2
torch_sparse==0.6.18
openai==1.59.4
dgl==1.1.1
```

3. Prepare the required datasets. Please download the dataset from [google_drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c5yqvUu3PBUhQHvUUlhzs_37IRWcHA2E/view?usp=sharing), and put them under the data/ folder. We have also prepared our annotation cache under the data/annotations/ folder. In most cases, this should be able to satisfy the requirement. If there are still omissions, please change the api url and key and generate the annotations by yourself.

4. Replace the configurations in config.yaml with your own config, and reproduce all the results with 
```
bash train_bash/best_cache.sh
```
